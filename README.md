# Week 1

## ML lifecycle

1. Scoping
    - define project
2. Data
    - define data
    - label and organize data
3. Modeling
    - select and train
    - perform error analysis
4. Deployment
    - Deploy in production
    - Monitor & maintain system

## Case study: speech recognition

1. Scoping
    - "Decide to work on speech recognition for voice spearch"
    - key metrics: Accuracy, latency, throughput
    - Estimate time schedule to finish this scope
2. Define Data
    - labeled consistently (i.g convention)
    - How much silence before / after each clip?
    - How to perform volume normalization
3. Modeling
    - Code (algo / model)
    - Hyperparameters, Data
    - **ml system = code + data**
4. Deployment
    - edge device -> mobile phone -> microphone -> VAD module to send speech API to the prediction Server
    - **concept / data drift**
